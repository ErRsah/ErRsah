## ðŸ”§ Expertise & Experience

### **Data Engineering & ETL Pipelines**
- **End-to-End ETL Development:**  
  - Designed and led projects that extract data from APIs and AWS S3 (with pagination and validation), transform data with custom logic, and load it into PostgreSQL.
- **Automation & Performance Optimization:**  
  - Automated ETL processes for multi-state oil & gas production datasets using Python, Pandas, and Apache Spark, reducing processing time by **60%**.
- **Cloud Integration & Data Migration:**  
  - Utilized AWS services such as S3, EC2, Glue, Lambda, ECS, MWAA, RDS, and Secrets Manager to optimize data pipelines.
  - Migrated legacy data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL while ensuring data integrity and performance improvements.

### **Advanced Data Transformation & Geospatial Processing**
- **Complex Data Transformation:**  
  - Developed robust logic to handle date formatting, JSON-style columns, missing values, and coordinate validations.
- **Directional Survey Processing:**  
  - Built scripts for merging CSV files, applying cubic spline interpolation, and performing coordinate transformations.
  - Leveraged **Pyproj** and **Shapely** to convert wellbore survey data into precise 2D/3D LineString geometries and organized outputs in AWS S3 for efficient workflows.

### **Cloud-Based Monitoring & Security**
- **Real-Time Data Integration:**  
  - Integrated REST APIs to retrieve and process real-time permit and well data from various state energy departments.
- **Secure Cloud Architectures:**  
  - Configured EC2 Security Groups, VPC settings, and IAM roles (following the least privilege principle) to safeguard communications between services.
- **CloudWatch Alerts for Slack â€“ Database Monitor:**  
  - Developed an integration connecting AWS CloudWatch with Slack to monitor critical database metrics.
  - Configured CloudWatch to track performance indicators (like CPU usage, memory, slow query, IOPS) and trigger alerts via AWS Lambda and SNS, enabling proactive incident response.

### **Academic Machine Learning Projects**
- **Model Development & Evaluation:**  
  - Completed multiple academic projects involving classification, regression, clustering, and neural networks.
  - Utilized popular ML libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) for model building, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
- **End-to-End Workflows:**  
  - Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, and deploymentâ€”demonstrating practical ML solutions across diverse domains.
