# Hi, I'm Roshan Sah! 👋

I'm a **Data Engineer** passionate about designing and optimizing **robust, scalable data pipelines**.  
My work focuses on **ETL automation, data transformation, geospatial analytics, cloud integrations,** and **AI-powered data extraction**, combining engineering precision with emerging AI technologies.

## 🔧 Expertise & Experience

### **Data Engineering & ETL Pipelines**
- Designed and implemented end-to-end ETL workflows extracting data from APIs and AWS S3 with pagination, validation, transformation, and PostgreSQL integration.  
- Automated multi-state oil & gas ETL pipelines using Python, Pandas, and Apache Spark.  
- Leveraged AWS services — **S3, EC2, Glue, Lambda, ECS, MWAA, RDS,** and **Secrets Manager** — for orchestration and automation.  
- Migrated and restructured data systems from **MongoDB** to **PostgreSQL** for better schema consistency and scalability.

---

### **Advanced Data Transformation & Geospatial Processing**
- Developed transformation logic for complex data fields (JSON columns, date normalization, coordinate validation).  
- Processed directional survey data by merging CSVs, applying cubic-spline interpolation, and performing coordinate transformations.  
- Utilized **PyProj** and **Shapely** to convert wellbore survey data into **2D/3D LineString geometries**, managing geospatial data in AWS S3 and PostgreSQL/PostGIS.

---

### **Cloud-Based Monitoring & Security**
- Integrated REST APIs for real-time well and permit data from multiple state energy agencies.  
- Configured **EC2 Security Groups**, **VPC**, and **IAM** policies for secure, least-privilege AWS architectures.  
- Implemented **AWS CloudWatch → Slack** alerting pipelines using **Lambda** and **SNS** to monitor RDS, EC2, and performance metrics.

---

### **AI & Machine Learning Applications**
- Integrated **Google Gemini API** for AI-assisted document parsing and metadata extraction from unstructured files.  
- Applied **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch** for model development, feature engineering, and evaluation.  
- Built ML-ready data workflows combining structured and unstructured data sources.

## 🧠 Featured Projects

### **AI-Driven Data Extraction**
Automated directional survey document parsing using Google Gemini API, AWS S3, and PostgreSQL for structured metadata extraction and ingestion.

### **Geospatial Analytics Engine**
Developed Python-based workflows for 3D well spacing, lateral geometry, and formation analysis using geospatial libraries and PostGIS.

### **ETL Validation Framework**
Automated validation and anomaly detection for pipeline outputs using Airflow scheduling and Slack-based alerts.

### **AWS Cost & Monitoring Automation**
Built dashboards and alerting workflows with AWS CloudWatch and Cost Explorer to monitor EC2, RDS, and S3 usage.
